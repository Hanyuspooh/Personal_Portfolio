###Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("static","img","blogs","tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The distribution of bike rentals for May and June 2020 appears to be more spread out when compared to previous years. This higher standard deviation in bike rentals in summar 2020 is as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown which changed the movement patterns of people in the city compared with previous years. People now use bikes rather than public transport for both essential travel and leisure.This explains some of the days in May and June that saw a high number of bikes being rented. However the lockdown has also caused bike rentals to be adversely affected on certain days with people having to work from home rather than office and not moving about as much. 

Monthly changes in Tfl bike rentals:


```{r, weekly changes in TFL bike rentals, fig8, fig.width = 13, fig.height=5}

#calculating actual and expected monthly averages for bike rentals
m1<-bike %>%
  filter(year %in% c("2015","2016","2017","2018","2019","2020")) %>% 
  group_by(month,year) %>% 
  summarise(actual=median(bikes_hired))
m2<-m1 %>%
  filter(year!="2020") %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(expect=median(actual))

monthly_average<-left_join(m1,m2,"month","year")

The blus line indicates the mean value for a particular month during the six years, so that is the expect value for that month, whereas the black line shows the actual rental amount for TFL sharing bikes in that month. We can see that apart from the obvious peak of bike usage in summer and lower usages in winter months, in 2016 the actual usage was higher than expected in the autumn months while in 2018 it were the summer and autumn months that witnessed higher rental income. For the year 2020, due to the pandemic, sharing bike usage droped significantly for the spring but went back to more than expected from May 2020 onwards, indicating a coming-back for TFL bikes and the rise of willingness of bike sharing for residents in London. The sudden rise shows how much people missed riding outside, as the demand keeps flat until July and there has been no upwards trend like the normal years as the summer comes.

```

We used the median rather than the mean to calculate expected rentals since the median is less affected by the presence of outliers i.e days with a very high or very low number of bikes rented. 

The green shadows indicate a positive percentage change and the red shadows mean the opposite. We can see a rise in spring months for most of the years and a decrease before winter especially when it comes to New Year. In 2020, however, after a mojor decrease due to the pandemic from week 12 to 20, as the lockdown ended, a sudden increase is seen for TFL bike sharing.
